Orange Pong

The game is a take on the classic game Pong. It begins with two oranges that bounce off the tops, bottoms, and left sides of the screen. The objective of the game is to move the paddle using the UP and DOWN keys and hit the oranges before they reach the right edge of the screen. If an orange touches the right side of the screen, the game ends.
