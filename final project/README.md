# KK Runner
This is my final project for CS2261, created in C and drawn by me. In the game, you play as Bob (the lazy, purple cat) from Animal Crossing. You're being chased by bees and have to jump over rocks and catch bugs for as long as you can. Use the LEFT, RIGHT, and UP keys to maneuver Bob. Use the A button to catch bugs. If you manage to catch three bugs, you activate the cheat.

### Running the Game
Run the Project.gba file to play!
