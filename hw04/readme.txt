SPACE DESTROYER

You're the pilot of the USS Starburst spaceship. While you're eating your lunch, a passenger alerts you to a torrent of enormous asteroids heading your way. You have to act fast. Your ship can't withstand any asteroid impact. Use the LEFT, RIGHT, UP, and DOWN keys to maneuver the spaceship out of the asteroids' ways. Attack and break the asteroids with the ship's Mega Blaster 3000 laser beam by using the A key.

Once you have destroyed all the asteroids, you can safely hyper-jump to another galaxy by moving upwards and out of the danger zone. Until then... good luck!!!
